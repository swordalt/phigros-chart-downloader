# Phigros Chart Downloader
A site that allows you to browse and download Phigros song assets (audio, illustration, chart) either individually or as a Phira/RPE-compatible archive.

Use it here: https://swordalt.github.io/phigros-chart-downloader/

(To download a chart as a Phira-ready file, scroll down and select the desired difficulty on the "Difficulty" dropdown menu.)

### Credits
The repository "Phigros_Resource" (created by 7aGiven) is used to fetch all assets. [Visit Repo](https://github.com/7aGiven/Phigros_Resource)

### Notice
All* assets are completely unmodified. Therefore, there WILL be minor visual bugs when playing exported charts in Phira. This is due to Phira's limited support for the Phigros file format.

###### *Note: Legacy charts (added later) will be converted to the current file format (v3) to avoid compatablity issues.

No assets are stored on this GitHub repo or the site itself.
