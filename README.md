# Phigros Chart Downloader
This is a site that allows you to explore assets by songs (charts, illustrations, audio). In addition, you can export an available difficulty of a song as a PEZ file to import into Phira or Re:PhiEdit! It should be automatically updated when a Phigros update occurs.

Use it here: https://swordalt.github.io/phigros-chart-downloader/

###### Note: Legacy charts (TBA) will be converted to the modern file format (v3) to avoid compatablity issues.

### Credits
We use the public GitHub repository "Phigros_Resource" (created by 7aGiven) to fetch assets. [Visit Repo](https://github.com/7aGiven/Phigros_Resource)

### Notice
All assets are completely unmodified. Therefore, there will be minor visual bugs when playing the chart in Phira. This is due to Phira's limited support for the Phigros file format.

No assets are stored on this GitHub repo or the site itself!
