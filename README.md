# Phigros Chart Downloader
This is a site that allows you to explore Phigros assets by songs (charts, illustrations, audio). In addition, you can export an available difficulty of a song as a PEZ file to import into Phira or Re:PhiEdit.

Use it here: https://swordalt.github.io/phigros-chart-downloader/

### Credits
The public GitHub repository "Phigros_Resource" (created by 7aGiven) is used to fetch/download assets. [Visit Repo](https://github.com/7aGiven/Phigros_Resource)

### Notice
All* assets are completely unmodified. Therefore, there will be minor visual bugs when playing exported charts in Phira. This is due to Phira's limited support for the Phigros file format.

###### *Note: Legacy charts (added later) will be converted to the current file format (v3) to avoid compatablity issues.

No assets are stored on this GitHub repo or the site itself.
