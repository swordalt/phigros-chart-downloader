# Phigros Chart Downloader

**Phigros Chart Downloader** is a project for exploring and exporting song assets for the rhythm game Phigros.

> [!WARNING]
> This project relies on a 3rd-party repository for assets. Refrain from making issues here about new songs not being added.

> [!TIP]
> Most charts will have visual bugs when played in [Phira](github.com/teamflos/phira). Most other chart players may not even support the official format.
