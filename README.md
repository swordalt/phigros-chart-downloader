# <ins>Phigros Chart Downloader</ins>

**Phigros Chart Downloader** is a project for exploring and exporting song assets from the rhythm game Phigros.

> *Refrain from making issues here (or asking directly) about new songs/charts not being available. That is <ins>**outside of my control**</ins>, since a third-party repository (not owned/managed by me) is used for fetching assets.*

### <ins>Usage</ins>

Use it here: **https://swordalt.github.io/phigros-chart-downloader**

For advanced information, see the project wiki: **[TBA]**

### <ins>Notes</ins>

1. This project is not in any way affiliated with Pigeon Games and therefore Phigros.
2. No assets are hosted or stored in this repository and website.
3. Assets are decompiled from the CN version of Phigros, meaning region-exclusive songs are available here.
